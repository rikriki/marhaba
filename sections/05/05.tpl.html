            Whatever airline or class of travel, our marhaba customers are welcome at our
            exclusive airport lounges. Open 24 hours a day, these friendly, peaceful oases
            are the ideal place to relax, eat or catch up with work.

            Our lounges are fully equipped with business services including PCs, Internet
            and phone (with free local calls), and an open buffet offering a variety of
            international cuisine and beverages. Some lounges have dedicated smoking
            areas. If customers want to freshen up, shower facilities are available in our
            lounge in Emirates Terminal 3. When itâ€™s time to board, our priority buggy cars
            take passengers directly to the boarding gate where permitted.
